#  Text Detection using Vision Framework with TesseractOCR

The Vision Framework has Text Recognition that can detect and recognize text easily. However it support English only.

This project try to use the Text Detection of Vision Framework to detect the text area then pass the cropped and perspective corrected image to TesseractOCR.
Since TesseractOCR supports multiple languages, I hope it can recognize Chinese text in app.
